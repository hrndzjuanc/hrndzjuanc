My passion for technology began at a very early age and using excel's VBA and macros I discovered a new world of communication with machines.

Since then, I have learned to use multiple languages and develop all kinds of applications to automate and make human life easier, even made some games as side projects.

I'm now a Senior Software Engineer with more than 8 years contributing to the digital world and
developing solutions for large and small sectors.

Among others, my strongest skills are:
Accurate planning and designing software architecture.
Assure best practices.
Proactive.
Critical thinking.
True team player.
